# Gen-7-Symbol-Research
Repo made for indentifying symbols in the US version of Ultra Moon, without updates.
Scripts are included in ghidra for Ultra Moon specific code.bin export and import.
If you want to contribute, let me know, but be warned that you'll have to wait for me to come up with a good solution for updating the symbols text without conflicts.

This is *not* a attempt at making a decomp or dissassembly.
